# Contributing

Welcome all! Thank you for your eagerness is contributing to the project, hopefully we can build something really special together.

If you have ideas for the project, or are interested in a task in the roadmap (see the README), then kick off proceedings by saying something in Issues. Make sure you check that your idea isn't already being discussed!

If we can agree that the idea is right for the project, I'll assign you the issue, and you can get started.

Once your MR is finished, I'll take a quick look, ask any questions, and merge it into the project.

I will try my best to use the all-contributors bot to give you credit, if I forget please say something.

Have fun coding :)
